This repository explores real estate data analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition. The project aims to identify the most significant features affecting property prices by analyzing various real estate metrics. PCA is employed to reduce the complexity of the dataset while retaining the most critical information, making it easier to visualize and understand the relationships between different variables.

# Abstract:
A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale price of the property. The ability to predict the exact property value is beneficial for property investors as well as for buyers to plan their finances according to the price trend. The property prices depend on the number of features like the property area, basement square footage, year built, number of bedrooms, and others. The prices can be predicted more accurately if the number of predictors is less. Several dimension reduction techniques are being applied to decrease this number of predictors.

# Problem Statement:
Read the youtube data and perform exploratory data analysis.

# Dataset Information:
With 79 explanatory this dataset describes (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa

# Variable Description:
Please refer to the data description text file provided

# Scope:

* Compute Principal Component from scratch 

* Compute Principal Component using sklearn


# Key Features:

* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, cleaning the data, and encoding categorical variables for analysis.

* Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA to reduce the number of features while maintaining critical information.

* Data Visualization: Visualizing the transformed data to identify trends and patterns that may impact property prices.

* Real Estate Price Prediction: Using the reduced dataset to build and test models that predict property prices.

# Conclusion
In this project, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, compressing the 35 original numerical features into just 5 principal components. The implementation was carried out using both an in-built library function and a custom implementation from scratch, providing insights into the process and the results.

The resulting principal components successfully captured the majority of the variance in the data, demonstrating that dimensionality reduction can be achieved with minimal information loss. This project showcases the power of PCA in simplifying high-dimensional datasets, making them more manageable for further analysis and model development. The ability to reduce complexity while retaining key patterns is a valuable technique for improving both computational efficiency and the interpretability of data.
